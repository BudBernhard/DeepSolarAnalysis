# DeepSolar Analysis
This project was created as part of the [Flatiron School Data Science Fellowship in DC].(https://flatironschool.com/) The fellowships educational material can be found within the [class repo](https://github.com/learn-co-students/dc-ds-100719). The analysis led me to the question of where demand for solar energy may exist but isn't being met. 

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore and better understand statistical modeling using the dataset created by the [Standford Deepsolar Project](http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/home.html) Using the data, I created a classifier to target areas that have at least one solar panel. By looking at the false positive results from the model, we can find areas that meet demand criteria but don't have solar. 

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is [here](http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/deepsolar_tract.csv), you'll need to open the csv and delete the first "," and re-save it before it will work with the code from this repo.
3. Now if you'd like to repeat my work find the open the technical notebook and run the cells within.
