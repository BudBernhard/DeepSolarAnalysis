# DeepSolar Analysis
This project was created as part of the [Flatiron School Data Science Fellowship in DC].(https://flatironschool.com/) The fellowships educational material can be found within the [class repo](https://github.com/learn-co-students/dc-ds-100719).

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to explore and better understand statistical modeling using the dataset created by the [Standford Deepsolar Project](http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/home.html)

### Methods Used
* Data Engineering
* Logistic Regression 
* Data Visualization

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is [here](http://web.stanford.edu/group/deepsolar/deepsolar_tract.csv), you'll need to open the csv and delete the first "," and re-save it before it will work with the code from this repo.
