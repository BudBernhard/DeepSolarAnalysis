    "### Summary:\n",
    "Can we predict where there's potential for solar investment in the contiguous U.S.? The Deep Solar project is a deep learning framework that analyzes satellite imagery to identify the GPS locations and sizes of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels. That project was developed within Stanford's [Magic Lab](https://magiclab.stanford.edu/) and [Sustainable Systems Lab](https://magiclab.stanford.edu/). This project aims to utilize that data to pinpoint areas where a) solar infrastructure is underdeveloped and conditions appear to be conducive, and b) there are opportunity zones for investment. "
